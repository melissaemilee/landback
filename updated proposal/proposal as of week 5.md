UP206A GIS: Mapping Vacant Parcels in LA County as Sites of Insurgent Planning and Healing

**Group**: Lupe Renteria Salome & Mel Liu <br>
**Group Name**: Land Access 4 All

## Introduction to Our Goal of Mapping Land Access and Use for Humans & Non-Humans

As pandemics and climate change disasters continue, open spaces and their natural elements are valuable in providing respite outdoors, lessening heat island effects, among other mitigation and adaptation purposes (drainage, carbon sinks, etc). Marginalized communities who have been dispossessed of land and power, have long experienced contestation and conflict with open spaces in their communities. 

We must also acknowledge the socio-cultural significance of the remnants of open lands, such as sacred sites and sustenance that native plants on these lands provide for local communities. 

**Definitions of open spaces:** For this course, we will focus on mapping and analyzing vacant parcels and their current designated use type and public/private ownership statues by neighborhood boundaries. Additionally based on what data is complete and compatible, we hope to layer in information regarding protected wildlife areas, parks, community gardens, natural features, soil conditions and other EPA considerations.

## How did we decide to map vacant parcels in Los Angeles?

In 222A Histories and Theories of Planning, we learned about how research is often used to answer questions we already know the answers to. What both of us don't know the answer to yet are where are more possibilities for BIPOC communities to take land back amidst housing shortages and privatization, as well as government misuse of public lands. We both connected around an interest in how humans can be in community on land outside of colonial frameworks, which means acknowledging animals, plants, and the lifegiving and lifetaking forces of nature.

Developers and other colonizing forces often do not consider natural climate risks such as fire, water shortage, landslides, etc. in their long-term development plans. Incorporating natural climate risks can potentially inform and influence what areas are eligible for further development.     

Through vacant lot information in Los Angeles, we hope to support community stakeholders and organize efforts in challenging more equitable use of the land for both humans and non-human stakeholders, such as community gardens or native plants and wildlife corridors (supporting bee populations, migratory birds, etc). As such, our hope is to focus on the East Los Angeles area where many community land trusts organizing is currently happening. We also want to acknowledge the need for affordable housing, and communities to decide what is best for them to do with this information.


## Land acknowledgement:

As students in the UPC206A GIS course at UCLA, we acknowledge the Gabrielino/Tongva peoples as the traditional land caretakers of Tovaangar (the Los Angeles basin and So. Channel Islands). As a land grant institution, we pay our respects to the Honuukvetam (Ancestors), ‘Ahiihirom (Elders) and ‘Eyoohiinkem (our relatives/relations) past, present and emerging.

## Research Question

What can existing spatial data tell us about how much open space is there in LA county (or smaller subarea of LA County) and 1) how much of this open space is accessible for human use? And 2) how much of this open space is intended or sustain plant and animal habitats, in addition to use by marginalized communities? We will focus on Black, Hispanic, American Indian Alaskan Native, and Asian demographic populations as available to us through the US census.

## Data sets: 
### [**shape file of Los Angeles Country Community Boundaries (CSA) Countywide Statistical Area (formerly called Board Approved Statistical Areas).**](https://data.lacounty.gov/GIS-Data/Community-Boundaries-CSA-/g4rb-en2z) 

These provide a common geographic boundary for reporting departmental statistics for unincorporated areas to the Board of Supervisors. They can serve as proxies for neighborhood areas.

###  [** Vacant Parcels LA County - from ASR Use Code.**](https://data.lacounty.gov/Parcel-/Vacant-Parcels-LA-County-from-ASR-Use-Code/vcaw-zeg9) This is a subset of the Valuation and property description for parcels on the Assessor's annual secured assessment roll for 2015. This set is only parcels that were vacant in 2015 (see note under concerns below).

## Intended analysis and resulting visualizations
Key to our analysis is the spatial join of community boundaries with parcel coordinates. From here we will present visualizations and analysis by neighborhood boundaries in Los Angele County with specific focus on our area of interest in the neighborhoods of East Los Angeles. Given it’s active land trust work, and majority BIPOC residents, we will start with El Sereno.

## Potential Insights 
We hope this will be an opportunity for us to reframe planning; how can one reimagine a healthy relationship to land and build an urban environment through a holistic and racial just lens that preserves existing ecological environments and expands access to open space for marginalized communities?
