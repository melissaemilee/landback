UP206A GIS mapping around open and public lands for the people


## Introduction
As pandemics and climate change disasters continue, open spaces and their natural elements are valuable in providing respite outdoors, lessening heat island effects, among other mitigation and adaptation purposes (drainage, carbon sinks, etc). Marginalized communities who have been dispossessed of resources (and land) and their power have long experienced contestation and conflict with open spaces in their communities. We must also acknowledge the socio-cultural significance of the remnants of open lands, such as sacred sites and sustenance that native plants on these lands provide for local communities. 

Definitions of open spaces: natural land, protected wildlife sanctuaries, parks, community gardens, vacant parcels (land under state or private ownership with the intention to be developed), if possible, cattle grazing lands, and agricultural lands

## Importance & what's at stake
Additionally, developers and other colonizing forces often do not consider natural climate risks such as fire, water shortage, landslides, etc. in their long-term development plans. Incorporating natural climate risks can potentially inform and influence what areas are eligible for further development.     

Furthermore, traditional landscaping in public open spaces, such as lawns and invasive plant species may be more extractive than beneficial to the surrounding ecological environment.  Data that reflects where this type of landscaping exists can challenge more equitable use of the land for both humans and non-human stakeholders, such as community gardens or native plants and wildlife corridors (supporting bee populations, migratory birds, etc).   

## Research Question
What can existing spatial data tell us about how much open space is there in LA county (or smaller subarea of LA County) and 1) how much of this open space is accessible for human use? And 2) how much of this open space is intended or sustain plant and animal habitats?

## Data sets: 
Publicly owned Parcels https://data.lacounty.gov/Parcel-/Assessor-Publicly-Owned-Parcels-Listing/a9jw-tqfp/data 
A new map of Los Angeles’s publicly owned land created by the city controller is intended to get residents thinking about how to maximize the potential of these often underutilized properties. This data can provide a better understanding of where potential contested sites of land in the county are located (ie contested ownership, development of a vacant parcel, community garden, natural land, etc…)

“Listing of current parcels within Los Angeles County owned by governmental or public agencies. NOTE: Because of lesser priority given to maintaining property records for non-taxable government-owned parcels, the parcel usage and even the property address shown here may not be up-to-date.”

Protected Open Space Areas – SCAG Region https://gisdata-scag.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/protected-open-space-areas-scag-region/explore?showTable=true
[DESCRIPTION]

“California Protected Areas Database (CPAD) is suitable for a wide range of planning, assessment, analysis and display purposes. CPAD should not be used as the basis for regulatory, legal or other specific governmental actions. Read the CPAD Data Disclaimer for more information.

This dataset includes the boundaries of California Protected Areas, lands that are protected for open space purposes. Data includes all such areas in California, from small urban parks to large national parks and forests, mostly aligned to assessor parcel boundaries. Data is collected by Holdings (parcels) which are aggregated to Units (commonly named areas within a county) and Super Units (commonly named areas generally).”

The SCAG dataset is limited to the Southern California region, while CPAD GIS data exists for the entire state

California Protected Areas Database are GIS shapefiles that show “lands that are owned in fee and protected for open space purposes by over 1,000 public agencies or non-profit organizations. CPAD depicts the wide diversity of parks and open spaces in California, ranging from our largest National Forests and Parks to neighborhood pocket parks.”

This dataset was downloaded through Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) the nation's largest metropolitan planning organization, representing six counties, 191 cities and more than 19 million residents. “The SCAG GIS Services Program was initiated and organized starting in the late 1980s with the goal of being the preeminent source of information for the southern California region. The purpose of the program is to derive and promote a model policy for distributing geospatial data and other information developed and maintained at SCAG. We believe so strongly in providing this service to stakeholders that we have incorporated this philosophy into our Ten Year Strategic Plan.”

Per the manual for CPAD, “This edition of CPAD should be cited in any maps, reports, websites or other products as: “California Protected Areas Database (CPAD) – www.calands.org (June 2020)”

## Intended analysis and resulting visualizations
Urban development and social processes alter ecological properties that reciprocally influence human societies. A visual overlay of open space and the publilcy oned parcels can provide a better perspective for us to analyze land usage and accessibility in LA county. Acknowledging the impacts of settler colonialism and the depletion of native plants that served as primary food sources to Indigenous tribes. Potential visuals may also include TIGER/line shapefiles that reflect political boundaries, census statistical boundaries.

## Potential Insights 
 We hope to receive insight on land LA county’s land ownership, usge and ptentual development impacts. It is an opportunity for us to reframe planning; how can one reimagine a healthy relationship to land and build an urban environment through a holistic and racial just lens that preserves existing ecological environments and expands access to open space for marginalized communities?
